    <string name="short_how_to_play">Be the first team to reach 7 points. To gain points, make sure someone from your team isn’t caught holding the Catch Phrase game unit when the timer runs out.</string>
    <string name="to_start_a_new_game">To Start a New Game</string>
    <string name="start_1">1. Select a Category. Only words from that category will appear on the screen</string>
    <string name="start_2">2. Make your teams! It’s best to alternate players in a circle so each player is next to a member of the other team.</string>
    <string name="start_3">3. Select team names. Come up with something funny and original. Or you can just be Team 1 and Team 2. Nothing wrong with some classics!</string>
    <string name="playing_a_round">Playing a round</string>
    <string name="round_explanation">Each game consists of several rounds of play. Once you’ve decided on team names, pick a player on the first team to go first. Give the Catch Phrase game unit to that player. Press the “Start Game!” button to start the timer. A word from the chosen category will appear on the screen. You can press the “Next” button to show the new word. Now you need to get your team to guess that word by giving them clues. Here’s how.</string>
    <string name="round_rule_1">• You can make any physical gesture and give almost any verbal clue to get your team to say the word. But you CANNOT:</string>
    <string name="round_rule_2">•\tSay a word that RHYMES with the word;</string>
    <string name="round_rule_3">• Give the FIRST LETTER of the word;</string>
    <string name="round_rule_4">• SAY A PART OF THE WORD in the clue (i.e. “shoe” for “shoe horn”).</string>
    <string name="round_5">If the other team catches you committing any of these no-no’s you must press the “Stop” button to shut the timer off. The other team automatically gets one point for that round. (See “How to Score Points.”)</string>
    <string name="round_end">As soon as your team has guessed the word, hand the game unit to a member of the other team. Play continues with the new team pressing the Next button to reveal the next word. The round ends when the buzzer sounds and the timer runs out.</string>
    <string name="how_to_score_points">How to Score Points</string>
    <string name="scoring_explanation">When the bomb goes off, time is up. The team NOT holding the game unit gets 1 point. That team also has one turn to guess the word that the losing team did not get. If they guess correctly, they get 1 BONUS point (scoring a total of 2 points for the round).</string>
    <string name="how_to_enter_points">How to Enter Points</string>
    <string name="enter_points_explanation">You must wait until the timer has run out, or is stopped, before you can enter points. The losing team (the team left holding the game unit when the round ended) awards 1 point to the winning team by pressing the appropriate “+” button.</string>
    <string name="winning">Winning</string>
    <string name="winning_explanation">The first team to reach 7 points wins. The game will play clap for you and display the winning team when the final point is assigned!</string>
